Hello! If you're reading this, you're probably Tau Beta's newest Historian. I was in your shoes once too, and took
on the task of trying to get accurate and consistent records of the Tau Beta Family Trees. I wanted to A. get
the right data for the trees, and B. make it easy to update the trees for future generations (as I figured drawing
a new family tree each year would be tedious and annoying). I landed on writing a program that would make family
tree images for you, provided you feed in big/little data. The format of these big/little files are as follows:

Big           |   Little
---------------------------
Joe Mama      |  John Doe
Joe Mama      |  Jane Doe
Jane Doe      |  Alan Turing
etc.

NOTE: ALL ELEMENTS MUST BE DISTINCT NAMES OR ELSE YOU MIGHT GET SOME WEIRD RESULTS
these files can be found in the tau beta officer resources. Or if you're reading this off my GitHub, there's a
sample file in this repo.

feel free to improve upon this code as you see fit, as I imagine eventually the libraries I use will be updated
and may not function like they used to.

If for some reason you find this code to be difficult/it wont work, don't hesitate to reach out to me
